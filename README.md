# Digit Recognizer with a Neural Network
A neural network to analyze digits from the MNIST dataset

Goal: To take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is For every ImageId in the test set, you should predict the correct label.

Metric: This competition is evaluated on the categorization accuracy of your predictions

Submission File Format: The file should contain a header and have the following format:
  
    ImageId, Label 
    1, 0
    2, 0
    3, 0
    etc.
